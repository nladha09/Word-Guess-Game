# Word-Guess-Game :question:

This is a simple word guess game with a DC comics theme. Written in vanilla Javascript, with a reset CSS along with some CSS of my own. To play, just guess a letter by typing your guess on your keyboard. If you guess incorrectly 9 times, you lose. If you guess the word before that happens, you win. After you win or lose, you can restart the game by pressing any key on the keyboard. Goodluck!!
